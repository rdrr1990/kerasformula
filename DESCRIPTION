Description: Adds a high-level interface for 'keras' neural nets. kms() fits neural net and accepts R formulas to aid data munging and hyperparameter selection. kms() can optionally accept a compiled keras_sequential_model() from 'keras'. 
    kms() accepts a number of parameters (like loss and optimizer) and splits the data into (optionally sparse) test and training matrices. kms() facilitates setting advanced hyperparameters (e.g., regularization). kms() returns a single object with predictions, a confusion matrix, and function call details.
