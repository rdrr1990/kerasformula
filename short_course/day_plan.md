Plan for Day
================
Pete
8/16/2018

The short course will take place in Hynes 303. The schedule is of course subject to change but this should be pretty close.

### 9-9:15 Meet & Greet

### 9:15-9:45 Lecture 1: Overview & Learning Goals

### 9:45-10 Demo 1

Walk through install if need be, demonstrate basic of `kerasformula` functionality

### 10-10:15 Activity 1

'hello kerasformula' toy examples, participants answer quick questions in `activity1.Rmd` that highlight structure of input and output.

### 10:15-10:30 Break

### 10:30-11 Lecture 2: Key Features of Neural Nets

### 11-Noon Activity 2

Participants build their own neural net using their own data and answer short questions found in `activity2.Rmd` which prompts them to estimate several models, take notes on output, etc.

(Participants should have a sample of their own data in a `data.frame` which is clean enough to run a regression on. Alternatively, code will be provided to quickly construct such a `data.frame` too and which will be similar to the data used in the slides.)

### Noon-1 Lunch

### 1-1:30 Lecture 3: Pre-processing

Data reduction of text counts/ranks via embedding...

### 1:30-2 Activity 3

Participants complete embedding worksheet (`activity3.Rmd`) using their own data or provided data (if latter more amendable to working with counts / ranks of text).

### 2-2:15 Break

### 2:15-3 Lecture 4: Advanced Neural Nets (CNNs, etc.)

### 3-3:30 Demo 2: Coding in Keras for Multidimensional Data (e.g., images)

### 3:30-4 Activity 4

`activity4.Rmd` will walk participants through coding advanced neural nets in `keras` (again using their choice of their own data or demo data).

### 4-4:15 Break

### 4:15-5 Lecture 5: Promises and Pitfalls of Neural Nets for Political Research
